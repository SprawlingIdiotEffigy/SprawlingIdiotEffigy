<p align="center"> GENERAL DNI LIST : 

<p align="center"> - Pro/Darkshippers. Commshippers are fine, but if you ship anything within the borders of dark/pro please do not interact with me!
<p align="center"> - Non-sharing yumes. If you get genuinely upset when someone yumes with a character you do not own, I would prefer you do not interact with me, as I yume with a lot of characters and will not stop simply because you are upset or uncomfortable with it
<p align="center"> - Suporters of ANY problematic media. If you support anyone or anything that is problematic, please DNI. This does not mean someone who is interested in darker media, or someone who is interested in the problematic media but if you SUPPORT it, please keep away from me.
<p align="center"> - Pedo or Zoophiles. Even if it is an attraction to a fictional minor or a fictional animal, it is still disgusting and I do not want you interacting with me
<p align="center"> - Homophobes, Transphobes , Queerphobes, Anti-Xeno/Neo Pronouns ext. If you cannot accept people the way they are then do not interact with me.
<p align="center"> - Anti-Furry , Anti-Therian. If they are not sexualizing animals there is no issue with them. Not all of them fall under the actions of the stranger part of the community. A vast majority are people just having fun and enjoying their lives and if you cannot fathom the idea of them being happy, dni.
<p align="center"> - Racists. If you hate or discrimate against any person due to the language they speak , the color of their skin , their accent , of any defining quality of their race , do not interact
<p align="center"> - Anyone who wishes to engage about talks in politics. I hate politics , I hate trump , and I hate charlie kirk. If you support the ideals of these people , dni. I do not wish to talk about the crumbling ecomomy of the US.
<p align="center"> - Skin theives. If you engage in the act of stealing skins from others and claiming them as your own , or taking heavy inspo from someone who requests you dont , do not interact with me.
<p align="center"> - Problematic kins , systems, and yumes. This does not span to all , but yes , they exist. If any of these fall into line with characters like Val from HH or LeyLey fro TCOALL , keep away from me.
<p align="center"> - 15 or younger! I am 18 and generally uncomfortable with anyone lower than 16 interacting with me.
